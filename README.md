## LakePy

</p>

LakePy is the pythonic user-centered front-end to the [Global Lake Level Database](link). This package can instantly
 deliver lake water levels for some 2000+ lakes scattered across the globe. Data comes from three sources (so far!)
 - [United States Geological Survey National Water Information System](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis)
 - [United States Department of Agriculture: Foriegn Agricultural Service's G-REALM Database](https://ipad.fas.usda.gov/cropexplorer/global_reservoir/)
 - [Theia's HydroWeb Database](http://hydroweb.theia-land.fr/)

 
**Funding for this work comes from the Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP) Winter 2020 Grant**

_See the funded proposal [here](https://www.esipfed.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Gearon.pdf)_

## Motivation
Lake level data is incredibly important to federal and local governments, scientists, and citizens. Until now,
accessing lake level data involves laborious data-preparation and wrangling. We aim to provide this data quickly
and on-demand.

## Software Used
<b>Built with</b>
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Amazon Aurora Serverless](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/serverless/)
- [Amazon Aurora Serverless Data API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/data-api.html)

## Quickstart

### Installation
```
pip install lakepy
```
if you are using conda for package management you can
 [still use pip!](https://medium.com/@msarahan/anaconda-also-comes-with-pip-and-you-can-use-it-to-install-pypi-packages-into-conda-environments-9e7f021509f7)
 ### Searching the Global Lake Level Database
 The database can be searched using a name, a source ("grealm", "hydroweb", or "usgs"), or an identification number
 . The best practice for searching is to first specify a name.
 
 Let's search for [Lake Mead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Mead) instantiating a Lake() object.
```
import lakepy as lk
my_lake = lk.search("mead")
```
If there is more than one Lake matching "Mead", the search function will return a RuntimeWarning and display a table.

> "Search Result: 'Mead' has more than 1 Result. Showing the 2 most relevant results.
Specify 'id_No' or narrow search name."

|    |   id_No | source   | lake_name                           |
|---:|--------:|:---------|:------------------------------------|
|  0 |     138 | hydroweb | Mead                                |
|  1 |    1556 | usgs     | MEAD LAKE WEST BAY NEAR WILLARD, WI |

We will select id_No 138 corresponding to Lake Mead from HydroWeb's database and re-run our search 1 of 2 ways:
- Specify the **id_No** explicitly as a string

```
my_lake = lk.search(id_No = "138")
```

- Specify a **name** and a **source**
```
my_lake = lk.search(name="mead", source="hydroweb")
```
We _highly recommend_ specifying an id_No _whenever possible_ to avoid issues with similarly named lakes. Either way
, the search returns a metadata markdown dataframe

|    |   id_No | source   | lake_name   | basin    | status   | country   | end_date         |   latitude |   longitude | identifier   | start_date       |
|---:|--------:|:---------|:------------|:---------|:---------|:----------|:-----------------|-----------:|------------:|:-------------|:-----------------|
|  0 |     138 | hydroweb | Mead        | Colorado | research | USA       | 2014-12-29 00:21 |      36.13 |     -114.45 | L_mead       | 2000-06-14 10:22 |

It is important to note that different databases will return different types and amounts of metadata. Currently
 latitude & longitude are only available from the USGS and HydroWeb databases, but GREALM lakes will soon have them!
 
 ### Lake() object
 
 The "my_lake" variable is now an object of class Lake() which comes with several attributes
 
 - name
 - country
 - continent _(currently not supported for HydroWeb)_
 - source
 - original_id
 - id_No
 - observation_period
 - latitude _(currently not supported for G-REALM)_
 - longitude _(currently not supported for G-REALM)_
 - misc_data 
 - dataframe 
 - data 

importantly, my_lake.dataframe and my_lake.data are pandas dataframe instances with associated methods

```
my_lake.dataframe.describe().to_markdown()
```

|       |   water_level |
|:------|--------------:|
| count |     119       |
| mean  |     342.807   |
| std   |       7.34547 |
| min   |     330.75    |
| 25%   |     337.905   |
| 50%   |     342.26    |
| 75%   |     347.555   |
| max   |     365.43    |

### Plotting

LakePy allows for native time series plotting as well as map-view plots
```
my_lake.plot_timeseries()
```
plotly, seaborn, matplotlib
```
my_lake.plot_mapview()
```
